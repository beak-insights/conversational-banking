# Abstract
This study addresses challenges in Zimbabwe’s banking sector, specifically the accessibility and efficiency of customer service. The primary aim is to develop a mobile banking chatbot powered by Large Language Models (LLMs) to streamline access to financial services and support user-friendly interactions. The research uses a mixed-methods approach, incorporating quantitative and qualitative techniques to assess the chatbot’s effectiveness, reliability, and scalability. Methodologies include prompt engineering, API mockups, and usability testing through customer feedback. The conclusions indicate that the LLM chatbot can significantly improve customer satisfaction by automating routine inquiries and providing personalized responses. Key contributions of the study include demonstrating how LLMs can enhance service accessibility, operational efficiency, and customer engagement in a banking context. The project also highlights the benefits of integrating digital tools to drive financial inclusion, making banking services more accessible, especially to underserved populations. Recommendations for future development include refining the chatbot’s contextual understanding and exploring integration with additional financial services to meet evolving customer needs.
